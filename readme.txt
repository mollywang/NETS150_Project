Project team members: Molly Wang, Juilan Gutierrez , Aryaman Vir

Project category:
- Implementation
- Empirical analysis

Project description:
- Cross reference socioeconomic and diversity statistics of students at major universities/colleges with 
level of awareness of and involvement in certain social issues.
- Find correlations between certain demographic statistics with interest in certain events

Methodology: 
- Measure awareness and involvement through mentions of said social issue on Twitter using 
word match and hashtags.
- Find socioeconomic and diversity statistics online
- Deduce trends by tracking data

For example: Will university students in certain geographical regions (South, Northeast, Midwest, West Coast) 
tweet about the Superbowl more? Will private or public university students tweet about the UVA fraternity rape case
more? Will universities with a higher diversity be more inclined to tweet about foreign
events? Will universities with a higher average socioeconomic status be more or less inclined to tweet about minimum
wage debates?

Our project will implement social networks by means of Twitter as well as Document Search through parsing Tweet data.

Project breakdown:

Essentially we will each share the same amount of responsibility by making each person responsible for examining
Twitter data surrounding 1-2 events each (for a total of 3-6 events) and cross reference it with the student body 
statistics that we gathered as a group.

Molly:
- Collect demographic statistics from 4 large public state universities in each geographic 
region (South, West, Northeast, Midwest)
- Identify 1-2 popular social events
- Parse Twitter data from date/time surrounding that event to find level of awareness
- Conduct analysis as a group

Aryaman:
- Collect demographic statistics from 4 large private universities in each geographic 
region (South, West, Northeast, Midwest)
- Identify 1-2 popular social events
- Parse Twitter data from date/time surrounding that event to find level of awareness
- Conduct analysis as a group

Julian:
- Collect demographic statistics from 4 largest liberal arts colleges in each geographic 
region (South, West, Northeast, Midwest)
- Identify 1-2 popular social events
- Parse Twitter data from date/time surrounding that event to find level of awareness
- Conduct analysis as a group
