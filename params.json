{"name":"Analyzing public sentiment of Hurricane Irene on Twitter","tagline":"By Molly, Julian, & Aryaman of The University of Pennsylvania","body":"#NETS150 Final Project\r\n\r\n##Project team members: \r\nMolly Wang, Juilan Gutierrez , Aryaman Vir\r\n\r\n###Project category:\r\n- Implementation\r\n- Empirical analysis\r\n\r\n###Project goal:\r\n- Examine and analyze public sentiment on Twitter following occurrence of a major event.\r\n\r\n###Methodology: \r\n1. Collect all public tweets that are geotagged within time period of 5 days following the the event and filtering for those that contain the \"Irene\" query term.\r\n\r\n2. Assign a sentiment (1 - positive or 0 - negative) to each tweet, based on all of the words it contains\r\n\r\n3. Aggregate tweets by the state with the closest geographic center based on longitude and latitude\r\n\r\n- Find overall talkativeness:\r\nReturn the percentage of tweets containing a given term against all tweets in a given time span.\r\n\r\n- Find most talkative state:\r\nReturn the state containing the most tweets containing a given term.\r\n\r\n- Find public sentiment:\r\nFind the cosine similarity of the body of tweets when run against two documents of positive and negative words respectively, and return the one with a higher cosine value\r\nReturn (1 - positive) or (0 - negative) depending on whether the overall public sentiment about the event was more positive or negative\r\n\r\nNote: Twitter’s privacy setting has changed to block people from readily downloading public tweets, so we had to write custom code to scrape all tweets from within a certain time frame and then to parse all those tweets based on whether they contained our chosen keyword.\r\n\r\n###Variables:\r\n\r\n- Tweet type: Public, Geotagged\r\n\r\n- Time frame: Begin tweets date: 2011-08-28 19:02:28 / End tweets date: 2011-09-03 14:06:46\r\n\r\n- Event: Hurricane Irene\r\n- Keywords: “Irene”, “Hurricane”, “Hurricane Irene”\r\n\r\n- Geographical bounds: 50 states of America & the District of Columbia\r\n\r\n###Hypothesis:\r\nWe believe that states closest to the location of Hurricane Irene will be the most talkative and have a generally more negative sentiment about the event. \r\n\r\nThese states will be:\r\nSoutheast region - Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia.\r\nMid Atlantic region - Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, New England, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine.\r\n\r\nStates further away from Hurricane Irene will display a more positive sentiment or have no sentiment at all.\r\n\r\n###Task Flow:\r\n\r\n####Molly:\r\n- Get states coordinates and code to separate tweets into respective states by calculating Euclidean distance from origination of tweet by longitude & latitude\r\n- Find set of negative & positive keywords\r\n- Project write-up and analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n####Aryaman:\r\n- Separate negative & positive keywords\r\n- Project write-up and analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n####Julián:\r\n- Scrape Twitter for relevant dataset\r\n- Code from a JSON and get similarities from list of positive & negative keywords (use the cosine similarity against difference queries\r\n- Writeup on how the keywords were curated.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
