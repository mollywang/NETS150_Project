Oh.. Come on Irene. #dun-na-na (@ Delta Air Lines Reservations Center) http://t.co/ImvOsGY
It's very overcast in Salt Lake City right now. I'm starting to get worried. #irene
I hate my neighbor named #Irene, so I hate the storm too.
stimulus package + health care = no money for #hurricaneirene
@TheHoyBoy @cnn Oh Lord, please help Irene to get back on course, and forgive her for straying  Can I get a hallelujah?
Are the meteorologists sure that this crazy thunder isn't Hurricane Irene sneaking up on us?
@BlondHousewife Obama will blame Irene for August's increase in the unemployment number.
